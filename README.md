## WindowDevelopmentScoutingProject-FIBAUSA16U

Tools: Hudl Sportscode, Synergy, Excel Sheets, Dropbox

For the following project, I developed 2 code windows utilizing Hudl Sportscode, which enabled accurate tracking of single-game performance data and KPI analysis, including advanced stats related to Shot Selection, Playmaking, and Defense, for individual players. Hudl Sportscode, Synergy, and 
Excel were tools I used to conduct scouting assessments for FIBA U16 Canada player, Kamai Samuels, analyzing video footage and statistical data from games against Dominican Republic, Uruguay, and Brazil. The scouting assessments were presented via Dropbox to Team USA staff, which contributed to 
FIBA Team USA U16 winning a gold medal.
